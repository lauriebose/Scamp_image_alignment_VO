# Scamp_image_alignment_VO
Simple visual odometry based upon image transformation code, performed upon the focal plane of SCAMP sensor.
Program generates edge images of scene, with the latest image transformed to align with a previously acquired keyframe image.
These image transformations are performed entirely on SCAMP and can be used to estimate constrained camera motion.
